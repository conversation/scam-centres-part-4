<Pullquote className='py-6 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="I cannot bear this life any longer, and they might find out anytime that I am talking to you. I will jump from the third floor tonight, please come and help." />

In early 2023, Ling (one of the authors) was volunteering with a Chinese rescue group in Cambodia and received this text message from a young Chinese man named Jack. 

As the scam industry has exploded in South-East Asia in recent years, rescue teams like this have also cropped up to help victims that manage to escape with transportation, shelter and eventual repatriation to their home countries.. 

On the night of his escape, Jack told his supervisor he wanted to work extra hours to secure a “customer” (a scamming target). As the security guard slept, he silently crept out a window, closed his eyes and jumped onto the lawn below. He landed hard and briefly lost consciousness. When he awoke, he felt searing pain – he had broken one of his ankles. 

Jack managed to send his location to the rescue team and he somehow crawled 100 metres to meet the driver. On his way to a safe house in the capital, Phnom Penh, he saw on Telegram that the manager of the compound had put a US$20,000 (A$32,000) bounty on his head and threatened to cut off his hand if he was caught.

The scam industry is sweeping up billions of dollars from victims around the world, but as our research and media reporting have revealed, the scammers are oftentimes victims, too. Many are held against their will in slavery-like conditions with round-the-clock surveillance. Getting out is no easy feat.

## Three ways to escape

People trapped inside scam operations usually have three ways out. The first is to get their families to pay the ransom demanded by their captors. This is far from a safe choice, as scam groups are known to re-sell people to other industry operators even after receiving the money.

The second is to attempt an escape, as Jack did. As compounds often have high walls, guarded gates and barred windows, victims are often forced to jump out windows from several stories up. Some have suffered serious injuries, paralysis and even death.

Bolder escapes are not uncommon. In 2022, for instance, around 40 Vietnamese workers broke out of a compound in Cambodia and leapt into a river to try to swim to freedom. One 16-year-old drowned in the process.

<Tweet tweetId='1572180278290034688' />
</div> */}

The third way out is to ask for police intervention through official channels. For instance, people trapped in Cambodian compounds can call a dedicated hotline or leave SOS messages to the social media pages of government officials. However, this escape route is challenging given the links between powerful local actors and some scam centre operators.

<Tweet tweetId='1572180278290034688' />

In all three scenarios, getting out is only the first step. Survivors often then find themselves stranded in a foreign country where they do not speak the language or know anyone. Not only do they not have any legal documents, they may also be suspected of having engaged in criminal activities. Of course, this is often exactly what they have done, even if they claim it was under duress. Many end up languishing in immigration detention centres for months.

Among our interviewees was a couple who had a baby while in Cambodian immigration detention. The mother was 16 and already pregnant when she was trafficked by boat from China to work in a scam centre. This is where she met her new partner. He told us: 

<Pullquote className='py-6 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="When the due date approached, I begged the guard to let my girlfriend go to the hospital, but they just kept asking us for money. Finally, it was the rescue team who paid the fee, as well as all the charges for the delivery of the baby." />

<Pullquote className='py-6 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="But just a few days later, the immigration police locked us back in jail with our baby. My girlfriend was not able to produce any milk because she was malnourished. We were all covered with bed bugs, but when we asked for treatment, the guards again demanded tips." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={false}/>

<Pullquote className='py-6 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="My girlfriend fell into depression because it felt like the entire world had abandoned us." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true}/>

## How did Ben, Moira and George escape?

Ben and Moira were tricked into travelling to a scam centre in early 2024, as we detailed in part 1 of our series. They were finally rescued after Ben’s father contacted the Malaysian embassy in Cambodia, compelling local law enforcement to get involved.

Their ordeal didn’t end there, however. When Ben and Moira gave their statement to the police, a negotiator from the scam company was in the room, trying to interfere. Ben believed the local police station had been compromised. He feared they could be sold back to the scam centre. 

Eventually, though, after lengthy negotiations with the help of a powerful family friend who was well-connected in Cambodia, he and Moira were transferred to a larger police station in another city. A representative from the scam centre followed them there, too, and offered them a bribe.

A couple of weeks later, they were transferred to Phnom Penh, where they underwent another ten days of questioning. Finally acknowledged as victims of human trafficking, they were finally taken to a shelter run by a local nongovernmental organisation (NGO). They spent another three months there, waiting to be put on a flight back to Malaysia.

George, whose story we told in part 3 of our series, had been held in a scam compound in Laos and sold to another in Myanmar. His path to repatriation was similarly convoluted. 

While trapped in Myanmar, George managed to contact an NGO known to rescue people from compounds. Somehow, word got back to his managers who, to avoid trouble, arranged for a fixer to spirit George out of the country.

An armed escort brought George to a secretive holding cell.

<Pullquote className='py-6 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="There like around 15 boys were locked up there, with chains on their legs, big chains. We wouldn't even ask many questions because now you're trying to get out, you're already in your own situation." />

After spending a harrowing night there, George was taken by boat back across the Mekong River to Laos. There, he checked into a guesthouse. With no money or travel documents, he somehow convinced the owner that someone from an NGO would turn up to pay his bills. 

For months, George waited for the local anti-trafficking police to help him and survived by hustling. He befriended the cleaners at the guesthouse who shared their food in return for George helping out with their work.

Finally, the police came and moved him to a shelter in the capital, Vientiane, where he spent another two months, waiting: 

<Pullquote className='py-6 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="There was nothing to do, just every day wake up, sit, stand, sit, sleep, like that. … Life was just like that, boring. " />

**EXPLAIN WHO ARRANGED THE TICKET** eventually put George on a flight back to Kampala in July 2023, almost one year from the beginning of his ordeal. 

## The burden of proof

Escaping the compounds is often the [beginning of a second ordeal](https://globalchinapulse.net/lost-in-salvation-how-the-current-victim-identification-systems-fail-survivors-of-the-online-scam-industry-in-southeast-asia/) for survivors. One of the big questions they face after their release: how do they prove they really are victims?

The burden of proof is often an insurmountable hurdle. Most of our interviewees said they were asked by local police or immigration officers to provide evidence they had been trafficked and forced to work in the compounds. Few can do this.

A common tactic used by scam operators is to confiscate their workers’ phones, replacing them with company devices that are heavily monitored and used specifically to perpetrate scams. As one survivor told us:

<Pullquote className='py-6 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="We were only allowed to download certain apps for scam purposes. Sometimes they let us use our personal phones to send messages to family, but the manager would be there watching us." />

<Pullquote className='py-6 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="After my family paid a ransom for me, they gave back my phone but cleaned everything inside. So, I do not have any evidence to prove that they trafficked me." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true}/>

Another survivor was denied being recognised as a victim because police found a photo of him laughing with colleagues in the compound, which they viewed as evidence he had voluntarily worked there. Other images documenting the violence and dark side of life in the compound had been deleted by his manager before he let him go.

Ascertaining that someone is a victim of human trafficking is a lengthy and complicated process, even under the best of circumstances. Inadequate resources and limited capacity, as well as Bureaucratic incompetence and corruption in these South-East Asian countries – compounded by lack of coordination between law enforcement  across jurisdictions – can make everything infinitely worse.

## But are they a victim or offender?

In the case of the online scam industry, the situation is made even more challenging by the blurred moral lines. 

Criminologists have long pointed out [CAN WE LINK TO AN ARTICLE HERE?] that the line between victim and perpetrator is not always clear cut – a phenomenon known as “victim-offender overlap”. [LINK HERE, TOO, PLEASE]

The online scam industry is a perfect example of this – the scammers are often victims and perpetrators at the same time. In some cases, this happens right away if victims are trafficked into the compounds. Or, it could be more gradual if they enter willingly as a perpetrator and then become trapped. 

Many survivors who exit the compounds without police involvement simply choose to forgo being identified as victims, which would entitle them to possible NGO or government support for accommodation, flights and medical expenses. They prefer to pay a fine for violating immigration rules and return home at their own expense, so that they can leave as soon as possible and avoid the lengthy and uncertain victim identification process.

In some cases, survivors who lack travel documents resort to the services of “snakeheads” (another word for people traffickers) to return home, which puts them at risk of re-trafficking. 

And even after they return home, some find themselves [ostracised by their families and friendspeers](https://globalchinapulse.net/nowhere-people-in-the-china-myanmar-borderlands/).

This is especially the case in China, where the government has launched high-profile anti-scam campaigns. Some local governments have exposed individuals suspected of being involved in scam operations overseas by spray-painting slogans such as “Shame on Online Scamming” on the walls of their families’ homes. 

Alice, the Taiwanese survivor from part 1 of our series, who claims she was repeatedly raped inside scam compounds, faced a significant backlash when she returned home. Many blamed her for being greedy and naïve:

<Pullquote className='py-6 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="I felt so depressed when one of my best friends called me stupid. He thought I had fallen into the trap because I wanted to be paid a lot of money without considering if I was qualified for it. I told him it was not true. During the pandemic, I had no income, and my baby’s father had left me. As a single mother, I would have just grabbed any opportunity for my kid to survive." startQuoteIcon={true} endQuoteIcon={false}/>

## So, what can be done?

Moral judgements like this are not only simplistic, they are misplaced. We are careful in our research not to excuse the actions of those scammers who enter the industry willingly and profit from it. Still, rather than judge them, we want to try to understand why they made this choice.

Furthermore, blame for the harms caused by the scam industry cannot be placed solely on the frontline workers. Many more powerful actors, from corrupt government and business elites to criminal organisations, are allowing the industry to flourish in the shadows. And they are all prospering immensely from it.

Containing the spread of the industry will not be easy. It requires a concerted, coordinated effort involving governments across the region, law enforcement, international organisations and civil society and humanitarian groups. 

Crucially, there must be repercussions for countries that continue to host scam centres. State-linked actors and businesspeople tied to the industry in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar have already been sanctioned by the US and UK governments, which sends a strong signal. However, they represent just a handful of the elite government figures, businesspeople and criminals known to be implicit in the trade. 

More needs to be done to ensure these countries proactively address the issue. For example, the [Financial Action Task Force](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html), the intergovernmental organisation that monitors global money laundering, should scrutinise more closely the structural deficiencies and commitment of countries to address illicit flows connected to the online scam industry. Where such gaps are identified, measures need to be taken. revisit its decision to take Cambodia off its increased monitoring “Grey List”, **CAN WE BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT THIS IS?** given the clear evidence it is a source for huge amounts of laundered money around the world.

Tech companies, too, must do more to ensure their services are not used as platforms for organised criminals. They must also urgently address the proliferation of fake job ads on their platforms and identify and block recruiters, people traffickers and money launderers.

Capacity building for law enforcement and anti-trafficking authorities is important, where local counterparts are receptive, and enhanced cooperation across jurisdictions is crucial to disrupt these transnational networks and increase the likelihood of perpetrators being apprehended and prosecuted. 

Importantly, resources and support need to be directed to groups on the ground investigating the industry, facilitating rescues, and providing aid to survivors.

For the victims themselves, sharing their stories is also important. As George told us:

<Pullquote className='py-6 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="People have to be made aware of what is happening. People have to know about it." startQuoteIcon={true} endQuoteIcon={false}/>
