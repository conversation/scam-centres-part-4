In early 2023, Ling (one of the authors) was volunteering with a Chinese rescue group in Cambodia and received this text message from a young Chinese man named Jack. 

As the scam industry has exploded in Southeast Asia in recent years, rescue teams like this have also cropped up to help victims that manage to escape with transportation, shelter and eventual repatriation to their home countries. 

On the night of his escape, Jack told his supervisor he wanted to work extra hours to secure a “customer” (a scamming target). As the security guard slept, he silently crept out a window, closed his eyes and jumped onto the lawn below. He landed hard and briefly lost consciousness. When he awoke, he felt searing pain – he had broken one of his ankles. 

Jack managed to send his location to the rescue team and crawl 100 metres to meet the driver.

The scam industry is sweeping up billions of dollars from victims around the world, but as our research has revealed, the scammers are often victims, too. Many are held against their will in slavery-like conditions with round-the-clock surveillance. Getting out is no easy feat.

## Getting out

People trapped inside scam operations usually have three ways out. The first is to get their families to pay the ransom demanded by their captors. This is far from a safe choice, as scam groups are known to re-sell people to other operators even after receiving the money.

The second is to attempt an escape. As compounds often have high walls, guarded gates and barred windows, victims are often forced to jump out high windows, as Jack did. Some have suffered serious injuries, paralysis and even death.

Bolder escapes are not uncommon. In 2022, for instance, around 40 Vietnamese workers [broke out](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/casino-workers-08222022191219.html) of a compound in Cambodia and leapt into a river to try to swim to freedom. One 16-year-old drowned.

<Tweet1 />

The third way out is to seek police intervention through official channels. For instance, people trapped in Cambodian compounds can call a dedicated hotline or leave SOS messages to the social media pages of government officials. However, this escape route is challenging given the links between powerful local actors and some scam centre operators.

<Tweet2 />

In all three scenarios, getting out is only the [first step](https://globalchinapulse.net/lost-in-salvation-how-the-current-victim-identification-systems-fail-survivors-of-the-online-scam-industry-in-southeast-asia/). Survivors often then find themselves stranded in a foreign country where they do not speak the language or know anyone. They don’t have legal documents and may be suspected of engaging in criminal activities. Of course, this is often exactly what they have done, even if they claim it was under duress. Many end up languishing in immigration detention centres for months.

Among our interviewees was a couple who had a baby while in Cambodian immigration detention. The mother was 16 and already pregnant when she was trafficked by boat from China to work in a scam centre. This is where she met her new partner. He told us: 

<Pullquote className='' quote="When the due date approached, I begged the guard to let my girlfriend go to the hospital, but they just kept asking us for money. Finally, it was the rescue team who paid the fee, as well as all the charges for the delivery of the baby." />

<Pullquote className='' quote="But just a few days later, the immigration police locked us back in jail with our baby. My
girlfriend was not able to produce any milk because she was malnourished. We were all
covered with bed bugs, but when we asked for treatment, the guards again demanded tips." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={false}/>

## How did Ben, Moira and George escape?

Ben and Moira were tricked into travelling to a Cambodian scam centre in early 2024, as we detailed in part one of our series. They were finally rescued after Ben’s father contacted the Malaysian embassy in Cambodia, pressuring local law enforcement to get involved.

Their ordeal didn’t end there, however. When Ben and Moira gave their statement to the police, a negotiator from the scam company was in the room, trying to interfere. Ben believed the local police station had been compromised. He feared they could be sold back to the scam centre. 

Eventually, though, after lengthy negotiations with the help of a family friend who was well-connected in Cambodia, he and Moira were transferred to a larger police station in another city. A representative from the scam centre followed them there, too, and offered them a bribe in exchange for their silence.

A couple of weeks later, they were transferred to Phnom Penh, where they were questioned for another ten days. After Cambodian authorities finally deemed them victims of human trafficking, they were taken to a shelter run by a local nongovernmental organisation (NGO). They spent another three months there, waiting to be put on a flight back to Malaysia.

George, whose story we told in part three of our series, had been held in a scam compound in Laos and sold to another in Myanmar. His path to repatriation was similarly convoluted. 

While trapped in Myanmar, George managed to contact an NGO known to rescue people from compounds. Somehow, word got back to his managers who, to avoid trouble, arranged for a fixer to spirit George out of the country.

An armed escort brought George to a secretive holding cell.

<Pullquote className='' quote="There were, like, around 15 boys were locked up there, with chains on their legs, big chains. We wouldn't even ask many questions because now you're trying to get out, you're already in your own situation." />

After spending a harrowing night there, George was taken by boat back across the Mekong River to Laos. There, he checked into a guesthouse. With no money or travel documents, he somehow convinced the owner that someone from the NGO would turn up to pay his bills. 

For months, George survived by hustling as he waited for the local anti-trafficking police to help. He befriended the cleaners at the guesthouse who shared their food in return for work.

Finally, the police came and moved him to a shelter in the capital, Vientiane, where he spent another two months, waiting: 

<Pullquote className='' quote="There was nothing to do, just every day wake up, sit, stand, sit, sleep, like that […] Life was just like that, boring. " />

An international NGO supporting the shelter eventually put George on a flight back to Kampala in July 2023, almost one year from the beginning of his ordeal. 

## The burden of proof

One of the big questions survivors face after their release: how do they prove they really are victims?

The burden of proof is often an insurmountable hurdle. Most of our interviewees said local police or immigration officers demanded they provide evidence they had been trafficked and forced to work in the compounds. Few can do this.

Scam operators typically confiscate their workers’ phones, giving them company devices that are heavily monitored and used specifically to perpetrate scams. As one survivor told us:

<Pullquote className='' quote="We were only allowed to download certain apps for scam purposes. Sometimes they let us use our personal phones to send messages to family, but the manager would be there watching us." />

<Pullquote className='' quote="After my family paid a ransom for me, they gave back my phone but cleaned everything inside. So, I do not have any evidence to prove that they trafficked me." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true}/>

Another survivor was denied being recognised as a victim after police found a photo of him laughing with colleagues, which they viewed as evidence he had voluntarily worked there. Other images documenting the violence and dark side of life in the compound had been deleted.

Ascertaining that someone is a victim of human trafficking is a lengthy and complicated process under the best of circumstances. Making it even harder in scamming cases is the inadequate resourcing, corruption and limited capacity in these Southeast Asian countries – compounded by a lack of coordination between law enforcement  across jurisdictions.

## But are they a victim or offender?

Criminologists have long pointed out that the line between victim and perpetrator is not always clear cut. This phenomenon is known as “[victim-offender overlap](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12117-024-09525-5)”. 

The online scam industry is a perfect example of this – scammers are often victims and perpetrators at the same time. In some cases, this overlap occurs right away if victims are trafficked into the compounds. Or, it could be a more gradual process if they enter willingly as a perpetrator and then become trapped.

Many survivors who exit the compounds without police involvement simply choose to forgo being identified as victims, which would entitle them to possible NGO or government support for accommodation, flights and medical expenses. 

They prefer to pay a fine for violating immigration rules and return home at their own expense to avoid a lengthy and uncertain process. In some cases, survivors who lack travel documents resort to the services of “snakeheads” (another word for people traffickers) to return home, which puts them at risk of being re-trafficked.

/> 

And even after they return home, some victims are [ostracised by their families and friends](https://globalchinapulse.net/nowhere-people-in-the-china-myanmar-borderlands/).

This is especially the case in China, where the government has launched high-profile anti-scam campaigns. Some local governments have exposed individuals suspected of being involved in scam operations by spray-painting slogans such as “shame on online scamming” on the walls of their families’ homes. 

Alice, the Taiwanese survivor from part one of our series who was repeatedly raped inside scam compounds, faced a significant backlash when she returned home. Many accused her of being greedy and naïve:

<Pullquote className='' quote="I felt so depressed when one of my best friends called me stupid." startQuoteIcon={true} endQuoteIcon={false}/>

<Pullquote className='' quote="He thought I had fallen into the trap because I wanted to be paid a lot of money without considering if I was qualified for it. I told him it was not true." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={false}/>

<Pullquote className='' quote="During the pandemic, I had no income, and my baby’s father had left me. As a single mother, I would have just grabbed any opportunity for my kid to survive." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true}/>

## So, what can be done?

Moral judgements like these  are not only simplistic, they are misplaced. We are careful in our research not to excuse the actions of those scammers who enter the industry willingly and profit from it. Rather than judge them, though, we want to try to understand why they made this choice.

Frontline workers also can't be solely blamed for the harms caused by the scam industry. More powerful actors, from corrupt government and business elites to criminal organisations, are allowing the industry to flourish in the shadows. And they are all prospering immensely from it.

Containing the spread of the industry will not be easy. It requires a concerted, coordinated effort involving governments across the region, law enforcement, international organisations, and civil society and humanitarian groups.

Crucially, there must be repercussions for countries that continue to host scam centres. State-linked actors and businesspeople tied to the industry in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar have already been sanctioned by the US and UK governments, which sends a strong signal. However, they represent just a handful of the elite government figures, businesspeople and criminals known to be implicit in the trade. 

More needs to be done to ensure these countries tackle the issue. For example, the [Financial Action Task Force](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html), the organisation that monitors global money laundering, should more closely scrutinise the structural deficiencies and commitment of countries to address the illicit flows of money connected to scamming. Where such gaps are identified, they should be addressed.

  align=''

Tech companies, too, must do more to ensure their services are not used as platforms for organised criminals. They must also urgently crack down on the proliferation of fake job ads on their platforms and identify and block recruiters, people traffickers and money launderers.

International organisations must continue to strengthen the capacities of law enforcement and anti-trafficking authorities in Southeast Asia to help them keep up with nimble and resourceful scam operators. Enhanced cooperation across jurisdictions is also crucial to disrupt these transnational networks and bring more perpetrators to justice. 

Importantly, resources and support need to be directed to groups on the ground investigating the industry, facilitating rescues and providing aid to survivors.

For the victims themselves, sharing their stories is also important. As George told us:

<Pullquote className='' quote="People have to be made aware of what is happening. People have to know about it. " startQuoteIcon={true} endQuoteIcon={false}/>
